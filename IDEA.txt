- should back-end and front-end be in one project?
    No: they are separate entities kinda, and can be developed/tested/deployed separately
    Yes: configuration for dev is simpler and faster is they are in one project

- should allow everything to work with localhost for dev

- environment should be configurable... time to learn ant/make?
